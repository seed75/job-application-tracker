# Job Application Tracker – Claude Code Master Prompt

You are working inside my repo.
Be concise.
Do not explain theory.
Only output exact file changes or commands.
Do not repeat unchanged files.

Goal:
Build a minimal but production-structured Job Application Tracker (React + Supabase + PostgreSQL).

Architecture rules:
- Clear separation: controller → service → repository
- JWT auth
- All queries scoped by user_id
- Validation layer required
- Global error handler
- data-testid required for key UI elements
- Ready for Playwright E2E

Tech stack:
Frontend: React + Tailwind
Backend: Supabase
DB: PostgreSQL
Testing: Playwright

Work in small steps.
Wait for my confirmation before next step.
